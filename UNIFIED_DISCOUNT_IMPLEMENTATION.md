# Unified Discount State Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented a unified discount state management system that resolves the issue where plan details were automatically applying discounts. Here's what was changed:

### New Unified System

**Created `/src/lib/services/discount-state.ts`:**
- Single source of truth for discount state using localStorage key `'discounts_applied'`
- Custom hook `useDiscountState()` that syncs across all components
- Event-based updates so all components stay in sync

### Updated Components

**MedicareShopContent.tsx:**
- Now uses `useDiscountState()` instead of local state
- Discount toggle in sidebar now controls global state

**PlanDetailsMain.tsx:**
- Removed automatic discount application logic
- Now uses unified discount state for rate calculations
- Simplified initialization by removing discount state handling

**PlanBuilderTab.tsx:**
- Now uses `useDiscountState()` instead of local state
- Removed `initialDiscountState` prop dependency
- Toggle now syncs with main shop page

### Key Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Both sidebar toggle and plan details toggle control the same state
2. **Shared Calculation Logic**: All components use the same `getBaseRate()` function with consistent discount application
3. **Synchronized State**: Changes in one place immediately reflect everywhere
4. **No Auto-Application**: Discounts are only applied when user explicitly enables them

### How It Works

1. User toggles "Apply Discounts" in Medicare shop sidebar → saves to `localStorage['discounts_applied']`
2. When opening plan details → reads same `localStorage['discounts_applied']` value
3. Both pages now show the same discount state and calculate prices consistently
4. All components use shared `getBaseRate(quote, applyDiscounts)` function

### Result

✅ No more automatic discount application
✅ Consistent discount state across all pages  
✅ Shared calculation logic prevents discrepancies
✅ User control over when discounts are applied
