            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">What is a Hospital Indemnity Plan?</h2>
            <p>A hospital indemnity plan pays you cash when you go to the hospital. It's that simple.</p>
            <p>You get a fixed amount for each day you're admitted. Use the money however you want. Pay bills, cover groceries, or handle unexpected costs Medicare doesn't cover.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">How Much Do These Plans Pay?</h2>
            <p>Most plans pay between $100 to $500 per day you're in the hospital. Some pay extra for intensive care stays.</p>
            <p>The benefit is paid directly to you, not the hospital. You decide how to spend it.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Why You Might Need This Coverage</h2>
            <p>Hospital stays are expensive, even with Medicare. You could face thousands in out-of-pocket costs.</p>
            <p>Medicare Part A has a $1,676 deductible in 2025. Plus daily copays if you stay longer than 60 days. Those costs add up fast.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Real Example: 5-Day Hospital Stay</h3>
            <p>Let's say you're in the hospital for 5 days. Your Medicare covers most costs, but you still owe:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>$1,676 Medicare deductible</li>
                <li>$200 in additional copays</li>
                <li>$150 for medications not covered</li>
                <li>$100 for phone and TV in your room</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Total out-of-pocket: $2,126</p>
            <p>With a $300/day hospital plan, you'd receive $1,500 to help cover these costs.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Hospital Plans Work With Any Medicare Coverage</h2>
            <p>These plans work whether you have Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage, or a Medicare supplement.</p>
            <p>They pay in addition to your other coverage. Think of it as extra protection for unexpected hospital bills.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Coverage for Family Emergencies</h2>
            <p>Hospital stays don't just cost money. They cost time away from work and normal life.</p>
            <p>Your spouse might need to take time off to help you. Family members might travel to visit. Hospital indemnity benefits can help with these hidden costs too.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">What About Pre-existing Conditions?</h2>
            <p>Most hospital indemnity plans don't require medical underwriting. You can get coverage even if you have health problems.</p>
            <p>Some plans have waiting periods for pre-existing conditions. Usually 6 to 12 months.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">How Much Do These Plans Cost?</h2>
            <p>Monthly premiums typically range from $25 to $75, depending on your age and benefit amount.</p>
            <p>The cost is usually much less than what you'd pay for one hospital stay without the coverage.</p>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic">
                <strong>Quick tip:</strong> Compare the monthly cost to your potential out-of-pocket hospital expenses. If you'd struggle to pay $2,000+ for a hospital stay, this coverage might make sense.
            </blockquote>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">When Can You Enroll?</h2>
            <p>You can usually apply for hospital indemnity coverage any time of year. These aren't Medicare plans, so they don't follow Medicare enrollment rules.</p>
            <p>Coverage typically starts 30 days after your first premium payment.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Is Hospital Indemnity Right for You?</h2>
            <p>Consider this coverage if you're on a fixed income or don't have much saved for emergencies.</p>
            <p>It's especially helpful if you have health conditions that make hospital stays more likely. Or if you want peace of mind knowing you won't face big bills if something happens.</p>
