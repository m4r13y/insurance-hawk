            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">The Basic Structure of Hospital Indemnity Plans</h2>
            <p>Hospital indemnity plans are simple by design. You pay a monthly premium. If you go to the hospital, the plan pays you cash.</p>
            <p>There are no networks to worry about. No deductibles or coinsurance calculations. Just straightforward daily benefits.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">How Benefits Are Structured</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Daily Benefit Amounts</h3>
            <p>Most plans let you choose your daily benefit level. Common options include $100, $200, $300, or $500 per day.</p>
            <p>Higher daily benefits cost more in monthly premiums. Choose an amount that would meaningfully help with your expenses.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Maximum Benefit Periods</h3>
            <p>Plans limit how long they'll pay benefits. Typical options:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>365 days per year:</strong> Most common for hospital stays</li>
                <li><strong>730 days lifetime:</strong> Maximum total days across all stays</li>
                <li><strong>100 days per year:</strong> For skilled nursing facility coverage</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Different Types of Hospital Coverage</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Inpatient Hospital Benefits</h3>
            <p>This is the core benefit. You receive payment for each day you're admitted to a hospital.</p>
            <p>Coverage typically starts on the first day of admission. Some plans have elimination periods (waiting days) before benefits begin.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Benefits</h3>
            <p>Many plans pay extra for ICU stays. ICU benefits are usually 2-3 times the regular hospital benefit.</p>
            <p>Some plans pay ICU benefits in addition to regular hospital benefits. Others pay only the higher ICU amount.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Emergency Room Benefits</h3>
            <p>Some plans include one-time payments for emergency room visits that don't result in admission.</p>
            <p>Typical ER benefits range from $100 to $500 per visit. Usually limited to a few visits per year.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Additional Benefits Often Included</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Ambulance Coverage</h3>
            <p>Plans may pay a flat amount for ambulance transportation to the hospital.</p>
            <p>Typical benefit: $200-$500 per ambulance trip, with annual limits.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Outpatient Surgery</h3>
            <p>Some plans pay benefits for same-day surgeries performed at hospitals or surgical centers.</p>
            <p>Usually a percentage of the daily hospital benefit, like 25% or 50%.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Diagnostic Tests</h3>
            <p>Plans might include small benefits for expensive diagnostic procedures like MRIs or CT scans.</p>
            <p>Typical payments: $100-$300 per test, with annual limits.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Eligibility and Underwriting</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Age Limits</h3>
            <p>Most plans accept applicants from age 18 to 75 or 80. Some extend coverage to age 85.</p>
            <p>Coverage usually continues for life once you're enrolled, even if you exceed the application age limit.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Health Questions</h3>
            <p>Many hospital indemnity plans use simplified underwriting. You answer basic health questions but don't need medical exams.</p>
            <p>Common questions ask about recent hospitalizations, surgeries, or diagnoses of serious conditions.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Guaranteed Issue Options</h3>
            <p>Some plans accept everyone regardless of health status. These typically have:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Lower maximum benefits</li>
                <li>Waiting periods for pre-existing conditions</li>
                <li>Higher premiums</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Waiting Periods and Limitations</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Effective Date</h3>
            <p>Coverage usually starts 30 days after your first premium payment. Emergency coverage for accidents may start immediately.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Pre-existing Condition Waiting Periods</h3>
            <p>Many plans won't cover hospital stays related to conditions you had before buying the policy.</p>
            <p>Waiting periods typically range from 6 to 24 months. After this period, pre-existing conditions are covered.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">What Counts as Pre-existing</h3>
            <p>Usually defined as conditions for which you:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Received treatment or advice from a doctor</li>
                <li>Took prescription medication</li>
                <li>Had symptoms that would cause a reasonable person to seek care</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Premium Structure and Increases</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">How Premiums Are Calculated</h3>
            <p>Hospital indemnity premiums depend on:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Older applicants pay more</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit amount:</strong> Higher daily benefits cost more</li>
                <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Women sometimes pay slightly more due to longer life expectancy</li>
                <li><strong>Geographic location:</strong> Urban areas may cost more than rural</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Rate Increase Policies</h3>
            <p>Most plans are guaranteed renewable but not guaranteed level premium. Companies can raise rates for entire groups of policyholders.</p>
            <p>Rate increases typically require state insurance department approval and advance notice to policyholders.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Family Coverage Options</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Individual vs Family Plans</h3>
            <p>Individual plans cover only the named insured. Family plans can cover spouse and dependent children.</p>
            <p>Family coverage costs more but provides broader protection for household members.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Child Coverage</h3>
            <p>Children are often covered at reduced benefit levels, like 50% of the adult benefit.</p>
            <p>Coverage for newborns typically starts automatically if the mother has family coverage.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Integration with Other Insurance</h2>
            <p>Hospital indemnity plans are designed to supplement, not replace, your primary health insurance.</p>
            <p>Benefits are paid regardless of what Medicare, employer insurance, or other coverage pays.</p>
            <p>You can have multiple hospital indemnity plans, though companies may limit total coverage amounts.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Common Exclusions</h2>
            <p>Hospital indemnity plans typically don't cover stays related to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Substance abuse treatment</li>
                <li>Mental health conditions (varies by state)</li>
                <li>Experimental treatments</li>
                <li>Care received outside the U.S.</li>
                <li>Injuries from high-risk activities (like skydiving)</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic">
                <strong>Key insight:</strong> Hospital indemnity plans work best when designed to fill specific gaps in your existing coverage, not as primary insurance.
            </blockquote>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Choosing the Right Plan Design</h2>
            <p>Start by estimating your potential out-of-pocket costs for a hospital stay with your current insurance.</p>
            <p>Choose a daily benefit that would meaningfully offset these costs without paying for more coverage than you need.</p>
            <p>Consider your age, health status, and family history when deciding on benefit amounts and plan features.</p>
            <p>Remember that simple plans with clear benefits are usually easier to understand and claim against than complex plans with many riders.</p>
