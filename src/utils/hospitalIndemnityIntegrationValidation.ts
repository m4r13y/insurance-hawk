/**
 * Validation checklist for the enhanced plan builder:
 * 
 * ‚úÖ Plan structure detection utilities integrated
 * ‚úÖ Enhanced company card display with structure indicators

 * ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained for standard plans
 * ‚úÖ TypeScript typing properly implemented
 * ‚úÖ Component state management simplified and unified
 * ‚úÖ Helper functions for benefit extraction added
 * 
 * Integration Points Verified:
 * - AdaptiveHospitalIndemnityPlanBuilder.tsx imports required utilities
 * - Company selection enhanced with unified plan structure analysis
 * - Configuration step supports all plan structure types through one system
 * - UI rendering adapts based on detected plan structure
 * - Existing functionality preserved for Liberty Bankers and similar companies
 * - Allstate now handled through the same generalized system as other pre-configured plans
 * - Multi-series plan selection flow works for CIGNA/Guarantee Trust/Allstate
