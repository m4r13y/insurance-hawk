# Dental Product Grouping Analysis

## Pattern Analysis from Real Quote Data

Based on the provided examples, I can identify three distinct product grouping patterns:

### Pattern 1: Simple Annual Maximum Variations
**Example**: Ameritas Life Ins Corp
- **Characteristics**: Each quote ID has different annual maximum within same productKey
- **Variable**: Annual Maximum ($750 vs $2000)
- **Benefits**: Generally similar structure, may have slight coverage differences
- **Complexity**: Low - straightforward grouping by annual maximum

### Pattern 2: Complex Multi-Variable Structure
**Example**: Loyal American Life Insurance Company (CIGNA) - Flexible Choice DVH 5000
- **Characteristics**: Same annual maximum ($5000) but multiple benefit variables
- **Variables Identified**:
  - Calendar-year Deductible: $0, $50, $100
  - 100% Preventive Option: Yes/No
  - Disappearing Deductible Feature: Yes/No
- **Benefits**: Consistent structure across variations
- **Complexity**: High - requires multi-dimensional selection

### Pattern 3: Mixed Annual Maximum + Benefit Variations
**Example**: MEDICO INSURANCE COMPANY - Medico DVH
- **Characteristics**: Multiple annual maximums AND benefit level variations
- **Variables**:
  - Annual Maximum: $1000, $1500
  - Basic Services Coinsurance: 50% vs 80% (Gold vs Platinum)
- **Benefits**: Structured similarly but with key percentage differences
- **Complexity**: Medium - annual max grouping with benefit tier selection

## Key Challenges Identified

### 1. Inconsistent Benefit Structure Parsing
- **Loyal American**: Uses clear sections like "Calendar-year Deductible: $50"
- **Ameritas**: Uses different format "Deductible: $50 (Basic and Major...)"
- **Medico**: Uses "Calendar-year Deductible: $50" but different coinsurance structure

### 2. Variable Terminology Differences
- **Preventive Coverage**: 
  - "Preventive Services 100% covered" (Loyal American)
  - "Plan pays 100% on Day 1" (Ameritas)
  - "100% Covered" (Medico)
- **Deductible Features**:
  - "Disappearing deductible feature" (Loyal American)
  - No equivalent in other carriers

### 3. Benefit Categorization Variations
- **Loyal American**: Preventive/Basic/Major/Vision/Hearing
- **Ameritas**: Preventive (Type 1)/Basic (Type 2)/Major (Type 3)/Select (Type 4)
- **Medico**: Preventive/Basic/Major (no vision/hearing)

### 4. Coverage Level Complexity
- **Year-based progression**: "Year 1: 60%, Year 2: 70%, Year 3: 80%, Year 4+: 90%"
- **Immediate vs delayed**: "Plan pays 10% on Day 1. Plan pays 20% In-Network after year 1"
- **Simple percentages**: "50% Covered", "80% Covered"
