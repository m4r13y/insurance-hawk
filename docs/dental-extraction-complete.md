## 🎯 Next Steps

The dental quote optimization is **100% complete** and ready for integration! 

Would you like me to:
1. **Apply this same pattern to other quote types** (cancer, hospital indemnity, final expense)?
2. **Integrate with the React components** for seamless frontend usage?
3. **Add advanced filtering/sorting** based on the extracted fields?

The foundation is solid - all essential fields are captured, storage is optimized, and the system is ready for production! 🚀
